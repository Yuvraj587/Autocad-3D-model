Designed 2D elevation and layout and converted it into 3D model

üè† AutoCAD Project: 2D to 3D House Design Conversion
This project demonstrates the complete transformation of a 2D architectural floor plan into a fully visualized 3D house model using AutoCAD. The goal was to enhance spatial understanding and provide a realistic representation of the structure, suitable for client presentations or architectural evaluations.

 Key Highlights:
1.Drafted an accurate 2D layout including walls, doors, windows, and room divisions.

2.Utilized AutoCAD 3D modeling tools to extrude and render the structure.

3.Added realistic elements such as roof, windows, and staircases for a lifelike view.

4.Focused on precision, proportion, and symmetry to maintain design integrity.

5.Ideal for learning architectural visualization and showcasing CAD modeling skills.
